# Spectral-Forecast
An implementation after Paul A. Gagniuc et al. Spectral Forecast: A general purpose prediction model as an alternative to classical neural networks. Chaos 30, 033119 (2020); doi: 10.1063/1.5120818 https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5120818  This project gets 3 arrays as input in the main file (healthyArray and illArray as sample from a healthy and a non-healthy patients, while predictionArray is as sample from a patient) and gives the user an output as a similarity index between the array sample from a patient and the other samples. The output is shown as values in the editText and in a line graph.  The computation is based on the equations from the article above.
